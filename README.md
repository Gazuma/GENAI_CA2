# GenAI Model Repository

Welcome to the Banking and Covid-19 Model repository! This repository contains two distinct models implemented in Python:

1. **Savings Account Model**: A simulation of a savings bank account system. This model allows you to create multiple bank accounts, perform transactions, and analyze account balances.

2. **Covid-19 Symptoms Model**: A simulation of Covid-19 symptoms data. This model generates random data for various symptoms and allows you to sort and analyze this data.

## Contents

- **Savings Account Model**: `savings_account_model/`
  - `savings_account_model.py`: Python script for the savings account model.
  - `logs.txt`: Log file that stores details of the simulated transactions.
  - `README.md`: Explanation of the savings account model.

- **Covid-19 Symptoms Model**: `covid19_model/`
  - `covid19_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the Covid-19 symptoms model.
  - `results.xlsx`: Excel file storing the sorted dataset based on symptom parameters.
  - `README.md`: Explanation of the Covid-19 symptoms model.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gazuma/GEN_AI_21070521023.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired model directory:
    ```bash
    cd savings_account_model
    ```

3. For the Savings Account Model:
    ```bash
    python savings_account_model.py
    ```
   - Review the `logs.txt` file for transaction details.

4. For the Covid-19 Model:
    ```bash
    cd ../covid19_model
    jupyter notebook covid19_model.ipynb
    ```
   - Review the `results.xlsx` file for the sorted dataset.

5. Review the respective README files in each model directory for detailed usage instructions and functionality.
